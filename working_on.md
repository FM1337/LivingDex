# Getting Ready to Work on LivingDex

I mostly wrote this for myself (so I can remember how to get started), but this should help for anyone contributing.

 - run `setup.sh` to grab submodules and generate sprites
 - install the [heroku toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com)
 - run `source venv/bin/activate.fish` to activate the virtualenv
 - install requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
 - run using `heroku local`, then open `http://localhost:5000`

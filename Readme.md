# LivingDex

In Pokémon, a [Pokédex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pokedex") is a device given to a player early on in the game. It's used to keep track of how many Pokémon are seen, and how many the player has caught.

For some players of Pokémon, simply seeing (or catching) all the Pokémon is not enough. Some players want to have one of every Pokémon. This is called a [living Pokédex](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Living_Pokédex)

LivingDex is a website to help players track their living Pokédex.

If you're looking for the website, you can find it at [www.livingdex.xyz](http://www.livingdex.xyz).
